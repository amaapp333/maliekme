# An AMP-first, mobile responsive WordPress theme for blogging that you can use for free on your projects

"For many, reading on the mobile web is a slow, clunky and frustrating experience - but it doesn’t have to be that way. The Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) Project is an open source initiative that embodies the vision that publishers can create mobile optimized content once and have it load instantly everywhere."

It's early days for AMP and as such there isn't any WordPress themes that use the technology by default. We've decided to give it a go and built a simple, elegant theme you can use for your blogging. Open source and available for anyone to contribute.

Download, use for free and just have fun with it. You can check out the demo over at [http://amp.jessehanley.com/](http://amp.jessehanley.com/) ⚡️
